# hello-world
Homework wonderland

Hello, I will be using this account to store my homework and project files in order to be able to seamlessly switch between my personal and work computers when working on code. This semester (Fall 2020), this will mainly consist of .ipynb files for Jupyter notebook, and SQL scripts for DBMS work.
